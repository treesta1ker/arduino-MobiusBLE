# MobiusBLE
Enables connectivity with and control of Mobius devices.

This library supports BLE communication with BLE enabled Mobius devices using the [ArduinoBLE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoBLE) library. Thus MobiusBLE can be used on Arduino boards such as the Arduino MKR WiFi 1010, Arduino UNO WiFi Rev.2, Arduino Nano 33 IoT, and Arduino Nano 33 BLE. For the Arduino MKR WiFi 1010, Arduino UNO WiFi Rev.2, and Arduino Nano 33 IoT boards, it requires the NINA module to be running [Arduino NINA-W102 firmware](https://github.com/arduino/nina-fw) v1.2.0 or later to allow ArduinoBLE and MobiusBLE to function properly.

## LED Usage
When the `MobiusDevice::redLed`, `MobiusDevice::blueLed`, and `MobiusDevice::greenLed` LEDs are configured this library will use them to indicate different statuses.
| LEDs                           | Status |
|--------------------------------|--------|
| blinking purple (red + blue)   | scanning for nearby Mobius Devices  |
| blinking blue                  | attempting to connect to a device   |
| solid green                    | discovering service/characteristics |
| blinking yellow (red + green)  | failed to discover characteristics  |
| blinking red                   | failed to connect / device not found|
| blink light blue (blue + green)| sending a BLE request               |


## Examples
#### Discover
This example shows some debugging and discovering methods for Mobius devices. First it will scan for BLE enabled Mobius devices (expecting just one). Once a device is discovered it will attempt connecting to the device. After successfully connecting it will:
1. read the current "scene" ID
2. start the default feed "scene"
3. read the feed "scene" ID (should be 1)
4. start the normal schedule
5. read the current "scene" ID (should be 0)
#### Control
This example shows how a Mobius device may be controlled with an analog signal. First it will scan for BLE enabled Mobius devices (expecting just one). Once the device is discovered it will check the analog PIN (A0) every 2 seconds for the current state. When a new state is detected it will connect to the Mobius device and set the scene corresponding to the state.

## Dependencies
MobiusBLE is heavily dependent upon the [ArduinoBLE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoBLE) library. It was developed & tested using the version [1.2.1](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE/releases/tag/1.2.1).

## Troubleshooting
This library is far from perfect and the functionally can be flaky. Some common issues encountered during development include:
* ArduinoBLE commands *freeze*
* ArduinoBLE commands are continuously unsuccessful
* devices cannot be discovered
* services/characteristics cannot be discovered

To help troubleshoot the `MobiusDevice::debug` flag was added. When this flag is set to `true` the library will print more messages to the serial port.
Some other tricks which were often helpful to workaround issues:
* restart/reset the Arduino device by press and releasing the reset button
* connecting and disconnecting from target Mobius device with the nRF Connect app ([GooglePlay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp&hl=en_US&gl=US) / [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nrf-connect/id1054362403))
